Actual Vim
----

Warning: This is alpha software. It's slightly past the proof of concept stage. There are several blatant bugs and it lacks some important features.

Usage
----

This plugin relies on Vim itself, and operating system features not found in Windows. Thats means it's likely to only work in Linux and OS X for the near future. It's only been tested with an unmodified copy of Vim 7.4 thus far.

Just clone this to `Sublime Text 3/Packages/actualvim/`

Sublime will open a new untitled buffer when it loads the plugin. If all goes well, this buffer will act roughly llke Vim.

Misc
----

On OS X 10.7+, you should do `defaults write com.sublimetext.3 ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false` to enable key repeat.
